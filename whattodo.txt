Step-by-Step Guide
==================

1. Clone the repository:
   - Choose a folder (e.g., Desktop).
   - Run: `git clone https://github.com/an5onc/event-browsing-app.git`
   - Change directory: `cd event-browsing-app`

2. Switch to the frontend branch:
   - Run: `git fetch --all --prune`
   - Run: `git switch -c frontend --track origin/frontend`

3. Verify you are on the frontend branch:
   - Run: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
   - Output should be: `frontend`
   - If still on main, run: `git switch frontend`
   - To see all branches: `git branch`

4. Install Node.js and npm (if not already installed):
   - Download from https://nodejs.org (choose LTS version 18 or newer).
   - To check installation: `node -v` and `npm -v`

5. Install dependencies: this will install all dependencies located in the package.json file
   - Run: `npm install`

6. Run the app:
   - npm run dev or npm start

7. Daily workflow: when you open you comnputer and you want to start working on your page. 
    You need to pull any changes that your team members might have pushed since the last time you worked.
   - Before you start: `git pull`
   - Start working
   - Save your file after every edit. When ready to upload to git, follow next step.
   - Make your changes and commit: `git add .` then `git commit -m "Your message"`
   - Push your changes: `git push`
   - Note: GitHub will require you to authenticate the first time you push from your computer. This is normal for all repositories.
     Options:
       * GitHub CLI: install from https://cli.github.com and run `gh auth login`
       * SSH keys: generate with `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"` and add to GitHub
       * HTTPS + Personal Access Token: use your GitHub username and a token instead of a password
   - After you sign in once, your computer will remember and you wonâ€™t have to log in every time.

8. Troubleshooting:
   - If `npm install` fails:
     1. Upgrade npm: `npm install -g npm@latest`
     2. If still broken: delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again.
